"""
Call a tool, but actually the tool is just a way to get a structured response.

Work flow:
- Ask bot free form question
- Get back an answer in a parsable format.

How is this different from a tool call?
- Tool calls are because the bot wants to know something
- Tool calls args are likely info we gave the bot in the initial prompt
- Tool body does significant work. Here the body just collects the args.
