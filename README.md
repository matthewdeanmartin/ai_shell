# ai_shell

OpenAI-centric shell for giving safe, chat-optimized, filesystem access to an Assistant as a "tool".

Even if you trust the bot to run bash directly on your machine or docker container, standard tools will run up your
bill with excess tokens in the reply, or a command generates too few tokens and the bot doesn't know what is
going on.

This is an alternative to `code_interpreter`, tools running code in docker container locally, or tools running arbitrary
shell code locally.

## Installation

`pip install ai_shell`

## Usage

See these full examples. As long as the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is set, you can run these examples.

- [Pylint bot](https://github.com/matthewdeanmartin/ai_shell/blob/main/example_pylint_bot.py) will attempt to fix python
  code lint issues.
- [Test writer bot](https://github.com/matthewdeanmartin/ai_shell/blob/main/example_test_writer_bot.py) will attempt to
  write unit tests for python code.
- [Tool tester bot](https://github.com/matthewdeanmartin/ai_shell/blob/main/example_tool_tester_bot.py) tries out tools
  to see if they basically work.

This is the python interface to the tools, how you're expected to wire up the tool to your bot.

```python
import ai_shell

cat = ai_shell.CatTool(".")
print(cat.cat(["file.py"]))
print(cat.cat_markdown(["file.py"]))

ls = ai_shell.LsTool(".")
print(ls.ls("docs"))
print(ls.ls_markdown("docs"))
```

This is the smallest example to illustrate basic capabilities, also
see [here](https://github.com/matthewdeanmartin/ai_shell/blob/main/example_tiny_bot.py).

```python
import asyncio
import ai_shell


async def main():
    def static_keep_going(toolkit: ai_shell.ToolKit):
        usage = toolkit.get_tool_usage_for("ls")
        if usage["count"] > 0:
            return (
                "Great job! You've used ls. Summarize in paragraph form and we're done."
            )
        return (
            "You haven't used the ls tool yet. Do you have access to the ls tool? If"
            " there is a problem report it to the report_text tool to end the session."
        )

    # Creates temporary bots
    bot = ai_shell.TaskBot(
        ai_shell.Config(),
        name="Folder inspection bot.",
        bot_instructions="Run the ls tool and tell me what you see.",
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo-1106",
        dialog_logger_md=ai_shell.DialogLoggerWithMarkdown("./tmp"),
    )
    await bot.initialize()
    the_ask = f"""You are in the './' folder. You do not need to guess the pwd, it is './'. 
    Run ls and tell me what you see in paragraph format."""
    await bot.basic_tool_loop(
        the_ask=the_ask,
        root_folder="./src",
        tool_names=[
            "ls",
            "report_text",
        ],
        keep_going_prompt=static_keep_going,
    )


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

This is the cli interface, which is intended for testing, not for bot usage.

```shell
ais cat_markdown --file-paths pyproject.toml
```

## Features in Brief

- Many cli-like tools interfaces, such as ls, cat, grep, head, tail, and git.
- OpenAI glue for all cli tools.
- UX with a bot in mind.
- Security with mischievous but not especially malicious bot in mind.
- Bot (Assistant) boilerplate help
- Support for bots doing one shot tool use and goal function driven tool use.
- Bot have extensibility points.
- TODO: plugin system for tools.

## Analogues supported today

**Directories**: ls, find

**Files**: cat, grep, head, tail

**Editing**: sed, ed, edlin, patch, replace, insert, rewrite, write new

**Data**: cut

**Other**: pycat, token counter, git

**Tasking**: todo

## Prior Art

ai_shell draws inspiration from various command-line interface (CLI) tools and shell environments, integrating
features from traditional shells with OpenAI's language models. It is designed to provide an easy and secure interface
for AI-assisted file system interactions, keeping in mind both usability and safety.
