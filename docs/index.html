<h1>AI Shell</h1>
<p>AI Shell are command line tools for openai Assistants with the UX optimized for bots use, not optimized
    for bash compatibility. If you want to go that route, bash still exists, and you can assume the risks of letting
    an AI drive it. It also has enough assistant-support code to see how the bots do with the tools.</p>
